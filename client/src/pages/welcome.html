            <p class="">You can search the BEL Evidence repository for BEL Evidences. You can also create or edit BEL Evidences using the BEL Manager.</p>

            <p class="">How can I edit a BEL Statement? By searching for it in the search page and then selecting it to open up the Edit page (which mysteriously isn't available in the NavBar Menu up top).</p>
