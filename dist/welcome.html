    <p>You can search the BEL Evidence repository for BEL Evidences.  You can also create or edit
      BEL Evidences using the BEL Manager.</p>

    <p>What is a BEL Evidence? It is the BEL Statement, Citation information, Summary Text and Metadata
    associated with a BEL Statement.</p>

    <p>How can I edit a BEL Statement? By searching for it in the search page and then selecting it to open up
    the Edit page (which mysteriously isn't available in the NavBar Menu up top).</p>
